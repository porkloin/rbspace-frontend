I've been spending some time lately tinkering with my [Pocket Operator #33: K.O!](/2019/08/teenage-engineering/pocket-operator-33) - it's an amazing little device capable of making tons of little sampling projects with nothing more than the sound around you using the internal microphone, or a few samples recorded from an external source like a smartphone or computer. Here's a sample of something I put together from a couple of drum samples from GarageBand on my iPhone and a bass and woodwind sample from a Van Dyke Parks song!
